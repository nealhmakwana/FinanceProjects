# Present Value / Future Value Calculator

## Description

This Python program is an elementary financial calculator designed to compute the present value (PV) or future value (FV) of cash flows over discrete forecast periods and multiple growth phases. Users can specify the type of calculation (PV or FV), the number of discrete forecast periods, the number of distinct growth phases, and provide specific details for each growth phase, including applicable growth rates, length of each phase, and the type of cash flow (annuity or perpetuity).

## Key Features
- **Calculation Options**: Supports both present value and future value calculations.
- **Discrete Forecast Periods**: Allows users to input cash flows for specified forecast periods.
- **Growth Phases**: Handles multiple growth phases with varying rates and lengths.
- **Annuities and Perpetuities**: Supports calculation for both annuities and perpetuities in the final growth phase.
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Provides a detailed breakdown of each calculation phase and the total present or future value.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: Prompts the user for the type of calculation, number of periods, number of growth phases, and details for each phase.
2. **Calculation**: Computes the present or future value for each period and phase using appropriate financial formulas.
3. **Output**: Displays a detailed breakdown of the calculations and the total present or future value.

This project is ideal for those learning financial concepts or needing a simple tool to perform PV and FV calculations.
